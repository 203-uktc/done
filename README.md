Simple Calculator
A basic calculator application written in Java that performs simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project uses Swing for creating a graphical user interface (GUI), which makes it easy for users to interact with the application.

-----Features
=Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
-Clear input and reset results after each calculation.
-User-friendly graphical interface with buttons for digits and operations.
-------Use Cases
1. Basic Arithmetic Operations
Addition: Input numbers and press the "+" button to add them.
Example: 5 + 3 = 8
Subtraction: Input numbers and press the "-" button to subtract.
Example: 9 - 4 = 5
Multiplication: Input numbers and press the "*" button to multiply.
Example: 7 * 6 = 42
Division: Input numbers and press the "/" button to divide.
Example: 8 / 2 = 4
Division by Zero: If you try to divide by zero, the calculator will display an error message.
Example: 5 / 0 = Error
2. Decimal Operations
The calculator also supports decimal points. You can input decimal numbers and perform calculations with them.
Example: 5.5 + 3.2 = 8.7
3. Result Display
After performing a calculation, the result is displayed in the text field.
You can continue using the result for the next operation without resetting the calculator.
4. Clear and Reset
You can reset the input by clicking on any operation button after entering a number or using the result of the previous operation.
